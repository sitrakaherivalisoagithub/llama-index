We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nEats\n\nOur Eats offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. We launched our Eats app over four years ago. We believe that Eats not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Eats enables Rides Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Rides times. Eats also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Rides Drivers or who do not have access to Rides-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Eats provides Restaurants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Restaurants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses. In October 2019, we announced a majority investment in Cornershop, a leading provider of online grocery delivery in Mexico and Chile. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nFreight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry.", "start_char_idx": 13621, "end_char_idx": 16195, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8db1dab4-8f35-4276-a02e-f5fca2b655f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8db1dab4-8f35-4276-a02e-f5fca2b655f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4599f46a-1346-4382-82ca-a63a2d27e18c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "edcb767d-8f2e-4139-882e-f8f2aaea5245", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "8934a1a65e390e10b690946e9a34a990279758ed784b380156f8062a6de0e864", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "831d8e0f-427d-432d-8854-680c8268525a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62f34b3b6d03952dd904b8cf90bc861ebe36527a78e1a9ea3dcdb867b103ac0c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In October 2019, we announced a majority investment in Cornershop, a leading provider of online grocery delivery in Mexico and Chile.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand\n\nplatform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n\nIn March 2019, we announced the expansion of our Freight offering into Europe. Although Europe\u2019s freight market is one of the largest and most sophisticated in the world, we believe that European shippers and carriers experience many of the same pain points in their current operations as U.S. shippers and carriers.\n\nOther Bets\n\nThe Other Bets segment consists of multiple investment stage offerings.

Along the way to a potential future autonomous vehicle world, we believe that there will be a long period of hybrid autonomy, in which autonomous vehicles will be deployed gradually against specific use cases while Drivers continue to serve most consumer demand. As we solve specific autonomous use cases, we will deploy autonomous vehicles against them. Such situations may include trips along a standard, well-mapped route in a predictable environment in good weather. In other situations, such as those that involve substantial traffic, complex routes, or unusual weather conditions, we will continue to rely on Drivers. Accordingly, we believe that we will be uniquely suited for this dynamic phase during the expected long hybrid period of co-existence of Drivers and autonomous vehicles. Drivers are therefore a critical and differentiating advantage for us and will continue to be an advantage in the long term. We plan to continue to partner with original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), other suppliers, such as Toyota and DENSO, and other technology companies to determine how to most effectively leverage our network during the transition to autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nPlatform Synergies\n\nOur Platform\n\nThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.", "start_char_idx": 18178, "end_char_idx": 20924, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "866cb658-e9e3-4812-87ac-053972b558e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "866cb658-e9e3-4812-87ac-053972b558e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4599f46a-1346-4382-82ca-a63a2d27e18c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "831d8e0f-427d-432d-8854-680c8268525a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "614b8f6cc83c59b71295a56cc1fe7327728a33964497f881d4899dbafa5ab4dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "63a54123-42f7-4951-a53b-29a00adf7864", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "016b01629778d5cb007095102ab4626d7a4591b7368a2acef861cd35cac952cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Platform Synergies\n\nOur Platform\n\nThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.

This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020.\n\nIn December 2017, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) ruled in the Elite referral case that the peer-to-peer Ridesharing service UberPOP was inherently linked to a transport service and, accordingly, must be classified as \u201ca service in the field of transport\u201d within the meaning of applicable European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) legislation rather than an information society service. This ruling requires us to comply with national laws, rules, and regulations, if any, governing transport services in respect of the specific UberPOP product. The majority of our Ridesharing products in the EU currently operate under licensing regimes where one or more of Drivers, vehicles, or we are required to register or hold licenses to provide services. As such, while Member States can decide how to interpret this CJEU ruling in their national laws, rules, and regulations in accordance with applicable EU law, we believe the ruling will have a limited impact on our business and operations.", "start_char_idx": 30178, "end_char_idx": 32571, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95063b58-43e5-492c-8ccb-ae73721f0465": {"__data__": {"id_": "95063b58-43e5-492c-8ccb-ae73721f0465", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4599f46a-1346-4382-82ca-a63a2d27e18c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02c7ae4e-6ed3-4a1b-8d64-7c470778f2a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "f2f26ac907548a70a676a767df760510487fe4bebfda275eb4266fc7ab5dff59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dcbe1c7c-d6c1-4cac-8143-05bf160cd42a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "707dfd2d91e0434c3b2b372e9a56fca0730624250c555928c1bf0b956ebc3402", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As such, while Member States can decide how to interpret this CJEU ruling in their national laws, rules, and regulations in accordance with applicable EU law, we believe the ruling will have a limited impact on our business and operations.\n\nIn 2015, German authorities banned our peer-to-peer ridesharing product, UberPOP, after a court ruled that it violated local applicable laws, including transport laws, by intermediating riders with drivers operating without professional licenses.\n\nIn Italy, while we currently have limited ridesharing operations through our licensed ridesharing product, UberBLACK, in Rome and Milan and a taxi product in Turin, we continue to face limitations due to extensive operational requirements faced by licensed drivers.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, in California, State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. AB5 provides a mechanism for determining whether workers of a hiring entity are employees or independent contractors, but AB5 does not result in any immediate change in how workers are classified. If the State of California, cities or municipalities, or workers disagree with how a hiring entity classifies workers, AB5 sets forth the test for evaluating their classification. As we explore legal options, we have received and expect to continue to receive claims by or on behalf of Drivers that claim that the Drivers have been misclassified, and should be classified as employees.

The U.S. Congress has passed and may continue to consider legislation relating to the regulation of autonomous vehicle testing or general deployment. Certain U.S. states and localities have imposed legal restrictions or other requirements on the testing or general deployment of autonomous vehicles, and many other states are considering them. Autonomous vehicle laws, rules, and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the United States and in foreign countries and may impose restrictions on our ability to develop, test and commercially deploy autonomous vehicles on our network.\n\nData Protection and Privacy\n\nOur technology platform, and the user data it collects and processes to run our business, are an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust. Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our platform are the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a data privacy security law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and security requirements for covered businesses.\n\nPayments and Financial Services\n\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.

Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point products, such as UberPOOL, over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases.

Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition.

Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the CCPA, which provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches.

During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.", "start_char_idx": 272318, "end_char_idx": 275295, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14286f6a-f0ec-4a86-97f5-40d9c18681fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "14286f6a-f0ec-4a86-97f5-40d9c18681fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4599f46a-1346-4382-82ca-a63a2d27e18c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c27b1411-1a23-46a7-bc1f-3283ab59a723", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "43e95c2249ee47fe85cd6b656f06c51159b8403b518929539f4e3049e29cb89c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb2cfaa2-4934-4fd6-9133-a9c24f0b99a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "71a4bc5a8c7fa9ec56bc20ac4688ad1293e7afcb2960bbd769fc976be63ec013", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\nany action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;\n\nany action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;\n\nany action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\n\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\n\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision.\n\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.

For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation\n\nor commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Rides Drivers in Australia.\n\nWe deny these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\n\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States.

The test is referred to as the \u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in\n\nDynamex Operations v. Superior Court\n\nin 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity. AB5 went into effect in January 2020.\n\nAB5 provides a mechanism for determining whether workers of a hiring entity are employees or independent contractors, but the new law does not result in any immediate change in how workers are classified. If the State of California, cities or municipalities, or workers disagree with how a hiring entity classifies workers, AB5 sets forth the test for evaluating their classification. A similar ABC test was adopted more than 10 years ago in Massachusetts.\n\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of AB5 on our business.\n\nIn January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform. In addition, w\n\ne are considering legal responses, additional potential business changes, a potential legislative amendment and have filed a California state ballot initiative which will be voted on in November 2020. The ballot initiative does not ask for exemption from AB5, although many other industries in California received an exemption from the ABC test through special amendments.", "start_char_idx": 306077, "end_char_idx": 308444, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ca0ee1c-4122-4282-be9b-c2c5a8751c53": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ca0ee1c-4122-4282-be9b-c2c5a8751c53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4599f46a-1346-4382-82ca-a63a2d27e18c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "77e14a53-898f-4f5e-9c27-86f696b30158", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "52b45e13653c0314a81aa18becd0ff819c2c00252f548f16c58ba2bd37adb54b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "19413d38-89a7-47a7-9c2a-478134e3c629", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd62a6c8f19d986a8e73388de8379e7964f69318240ac13d35acaa78cc0d0641", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The ballot initiative does not ask for exemption from AB5, although many other industries in California received an exemption from the ABC test through special amendments.

In addition to revenue, net income (loss), loss from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted Net Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of Adjusted Net Revenue as well as revenue and ANR growth rates in constant currency, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAdjusted Net Revenue\n\nWe\n\ndefine Adjusted Net Revenue as revenue less (i) excess Driver incentives and (ii) Driver referrals.

We define Eats Adjusted Net Revenue as Eats revenue less (i) excess Driver incentives and (ii) Driver referrals.\n\nWe believe that this measure is informative of our top line performance because it measures the total net financial activity reflected in the amount earned by us after taking into account all Driver and restaurant earnings, Driver incentives, and Driver referrals.

We have concluded that we are an agent as we arrange for\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\nto provide the service to the end user in Rides and Eats transactions.

Because we have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips, and because we cannot control whether Drivers will generate future earnings that we can offset to collect our service fee, we have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\n\nDriver Incentives\n\nAs Drivers are our customers, Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Driver incentives that are not for a distinct service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the Drivers at the time or as they are earned by the Drivers, depending on the type of Driver incentive.\n\nWe evaluate whether the cumulative amount of Driver incentives that are not in exchange for a distinct service provided to Drivers exceeds the cumulative revenue earned since inception of the Drivers relationship. When the cumulative amount of these Driver incentives exceeds the cumulative revenue earned since inception of the Drivers relationship, the excess Driver incentives are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. As a result, Driver incentives provided to Drivers at the beginning of a relationship are typically classified as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, while Driver incentives provided to Drivers with a more mature relationship are typically classified as a reduction of revenue.\n\nReferral incentives offered by us and earned by Drivers for performing marketing services of referring other Drivers to drive on our platform are recorded as sales and marketing expense, as we receive a distinct service. The amount recorded is the lesser of the amount of the Driver incentive paid or the established fair market value of the distinct service received. Fair market value of the distinct service is estimated using amounts paid to vendors for similar services.\n\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\n\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users to encourage use of our platform.

We record the cost of these discounts and promotions as sales and marketing expense at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.\n\nEnd-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform and the new end-user takes his or her first ride on the platform. These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user when earned. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to our platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expense as sales and marketing expense at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.\n\nMarket-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers to end-users for all or substantially all rides or meal deliveries in a specific market. Accordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the trip is completed.\n\nEmbedded Derivatives\n\nWe have issued Convertible Notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our\n\n71\n\nstock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value.

This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\n\nWe assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations. If an investment in debt securities is determined to have an impairment that is other-than-temporary, if we do not intend to sell, and if it is not more likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt security, then only credit losses, if any, are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The determination of the impairment loss may include the use of various valuation methodologies and estimates.\n\nEquity Method Investments\n\nWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not own a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and / or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\n\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the ongoing impact of the Tax Act, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties.

In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\n\nInsurance Reserves\n\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers\u2019 compensation. The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses related to events incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment with consideration toward relevant industry claim and loss development patterns, frequency trends, and severity trends. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.\n\nAll estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from the estimated amounts.\n\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of our board of directors, and non-employee advisors.", "start_char_idx": 395689, "end_char_idx": 398502, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "303b3737-6115-48b9-be9b-a5479443764b": {"__data__": {"id_": "303b3737-6115-48b9-be9b-a5479443764b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4599f46a-1346-4382-82ca-a63a2d27e18c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a26ac555-1b8c-4410-b244-359e134f4fda", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "35ab14c3f24aaeb6a171fe354ee05bc2cba70f16f5b8fde22f5ecd3a90f4bb23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "db017be1-2b50-429f-816f-6df044c0c546", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a76eb09b0dc1e3caf16baf4573480d22b07d1e21d91ac38e46fa0defaa5ecac7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of our board of directors, and non-employee advisors.

The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on our weighted-average cost of capital, and is adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in our cash flows. The market approach estimates value based on a comparison of our company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2016 Term Loan Facility and our 2018 Term Loan Facility. The 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2018 Term Loan Facility are floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\n\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by\n\n$166 million\n\nas of\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\nInvestment Risk\n\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk.", "start_char_idx": 403095, "end_char_idx": 405606, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79571789-1308-44a3-b0b7-962ce5dba94c": {"__data__": {"id_": "79571789-1308-44a3-b0b7-962ce5dba94c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4599f46a-1346-4382-82ca-a63a2d27e18c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8eeb140-6f18-47c0-8558-2a45fcdd4968", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "17f78aa637ac4f2b46db176c8a80c6d2794577beeac266996507d134c92e45cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b058b448-d5da-4680-9bcf-d7ba381f145f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c41a5b46358d1fb0e33bb6de17d855f5aa51e6711873e04a4af24e098800ab6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by\n\n$166 million\n\nas of\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\nInvestment Risk\n\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling\n\n$8.2 billion\n\nand\n\n$12.1 billion\n\nas of\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\nand 2019, respectively. Marketable debt securities c\n\nlassified as short-term investments\n\ntotaled\n\n$440 million\n\nas of\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\n. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest income by\n\n$33 million\n\nand\n\n$115 million\n\nfor the three and\n\ntwelve\n\nmonths ended\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\n, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our marketable debt securities portfolio.\n\nWe have significant risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned affiliates, compared to their fair value, as all of our investments are currently in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. As of\n\nDecember 31, 2019\n\nthe carrying value of our investments\n\nwas\n\n$11.9 billion\n\n, including equity method investments.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nWe\n\ntransact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the Company\u2019s IBR, because the interest rate implicit in most of the Company\u2019s leases is not readily determinable.

The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The Company evaluates its reporting units when changes in its operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigns goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if the Company concludes otherwise, the Company proceeds to the quantitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

The Company derives its revenues principally from\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\n\u2019 use of the Company\u2019s\n\nplatform and related service which includes on-demand lead generation, and related activities, including facilitating payments from end-users, that enable\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\nto seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Rides services and Eats services (the \u201cUber Service\u201d)\n\nand from customers' use of Freight, Other Bets, and ATG and Other Technology Programs.\n\nThe Company periodically reassesses its revenue recognition policies as new offering become materials, and business models and other factors evolve.\n\nRides and Eats Master Services Agreements\n\nThe Company enters into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\nto use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee the Company charges\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\nfor each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, the\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\nagree to perform the Rides or Eats services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between the Company and the\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\nafter the\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\naccept a transaction request and the\n\nDrivers' and Restaurants'\n\nability to cancel the transaction lapses. End-users access the Platform for free and the Company has no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, end-users are not the Company's customers.\n\nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy the Company\u2019s sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\nwith end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\n\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\nand end-users. The Company evaluates the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether it controls the service provided to the end-user and is the principal (i.e.", "start_char_idx": 463691, "end_char_idx": 466319, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68e767bc-0477-4163-9ca4-5432a6ac1044": {"__data__": {"id_": "68e767bc-0477-4163-9ca4-5432a6ac1044", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4599f46a-1346-4382-82ca-a63a2d27e18c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e850f5e5579380f35194af32d50fcc6e5e744e27101acf7bd33e8e23418c5711", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8efb16d8-7701-4550-ad6a-c4649c218f15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "3efeaa423887fd762e754cc38606b6fb493ccdb4c5754e5b0080d83ce17cda6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8c93ac21-802c-44c4-ba0f-919ee267fd5b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9cda16b2d35031a8c5ec0ca719ca6c08c2a0cfceb1c767f815df919634fd1add", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Judgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\nand end-users.

This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to\n\nDrivers\n\nand discounts and promotions offered to end-users. For Rides and Eats transactions, the Company's role is to provide the service to\n\nDrivers and Restaurants\n\nto facilitate a successful trip or Eats service to end-users.

The Company therefore controls the service before it is transferred to the Shipper. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrier that meets the Shipper's specifications. The Company also has pricing discretion and negotiates separately the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to carriers.

These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform.

In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered.\n\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.

All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process.

Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. The Company records a liability when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

The Company makes adjustments to provisions and changes to disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss.\n\nThe outcome of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain.

Antitrust claims were dismissed, but the unfair competition claims remained. On May 15, 2019, Uber reached a tentative settlement with the plaintiffs in six of the seven actions, which are finalized as to all but one plaintiff.

The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from the Company\u2019s transactions with its Drivers, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value added and similar taxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on payments made to such Drivers. For example, the Company is involved in a proceeding in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify the Company as a transportation provider. Being classified as a transportation provider would result in a VAT (\n\n20%\n\n) on Gross Bookings or on the service fee that the Company charges Drivers, both retroactively and prospectively. Further, if Drivers are determined to be workers, they may be entitled to additional benefits and payments, and the Company may be subject to penalties, back taxes, and fines. The Company believes that the position of HMRC and the regulators in similar disputes and audits is without merit and is defending itself vigorously.

Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\n\n139\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by the rules of the SEC for newly public companies.\n\nITEM 9B.
