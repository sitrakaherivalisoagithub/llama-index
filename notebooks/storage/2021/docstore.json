Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.\n\nMobility\n\nMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate.

At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launched our Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\n\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly\u2019s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. The acquisition of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,\n\nwhich are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in an all-cash transaction, allowing us to expand our Uber Freight business through Transplace\u2019s expertise in transportation management. The acquisition of Transplace has been accounted for as a business combination.

Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.

Operational Excellence Our regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators. Product Expertise Our products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.\n\nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.\n\nWe believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing platform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform. Additionally, for the three months ended December 31, 2021, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 12.6 Trips per month on average, compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered.

Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.\n\nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\n\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021.

In December 2018, New York City also established a standard for time and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.

Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees.

To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigated this crisis in their personal and professional lives. We provided\n\nmore attention and flexibility to caregivers by providing resources, tools, and support, and amplified our focus on mental health and well-being.\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\n. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and are able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results of these regular checks to better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and growth opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was created based on employee feedback.

We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, satisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business.

Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created\n\nthrough its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.\n\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n\nAdvocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.", "start_char_idx": 45151, "end_char_idx": 47819, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08f17a86-3ae3-419b-b4be-b2a2795415f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "08f17a86-3ae3-419b-b4be-b2a2795415f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e94bb976-f2ee-4585-8387-d2860312e06e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dc2781b3c1da5891f0530b8dd1a01495fdb2e8e43d1f080ab984babe31ca384b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "814e5770-8576-4266-b502-fab62a8c4846", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "2a1a030fedac490b444ba2dc82e741f9b9af79bec2a4cd8a1b908d440ea98964", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbc182d2-dd29-4da4-b50a-e3461ac3bdbd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c06f981563b53e18dfb6c0b2b4c759604c3a7d0ed3b398694911e704cca63617", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n\nAdvocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and other app based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\n\nIn the United States, European Union, and Canada, we put forward proposals to improve the quality of independent work, calling on policymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having access to protections and benefits doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\n\nIn California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to provide benefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\n\nIn the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant to this change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paid holiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an even stronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\n\nProtections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, including implementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\n\nEarnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\n\nProgression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over 100 undergraduate degree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship.

If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\n\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. In August 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, and while the California Court of Appeal subsequently affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, on April 12, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation to dissolve the injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.\n\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.

Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.\n\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nAnother example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather than self-employed).

Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could harm our business and operating results.

Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council voted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire vehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. In August 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruising cap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City. Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.

Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not completing all necessary authentication steps.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\n\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.\n\nITEM 4.

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.\n\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.", "start_char_idx": 298728, "end_char_idx": 301221, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3237350-b377-4834-924e-cad0481e1211": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3237350-b377-4834-924e-cad0481e1211", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e94bb976-f2ee-4585-8387-d2860312e06e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dc2781b3c1da5891f0530b8dd1a01495fdb2e8e43d1f080ab984babe31ca384b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "47b9c9fd-51bc-48f9-b66e-7e3d36b4b19b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "078665d4a2d7f74c60d06d17c838e56321af92b388237723ce081061cec92340", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "083f0ec8-311a-4a2f-992d-35733ddf1874", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "43f104df7d0232e588aec8025e1b4773f7c442c31fe638aa91406b2eec2bcf3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.\n\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.\n\nJudgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\n\nIn certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives.

Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.\n\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\n\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions which are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates.\n\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.

These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.

These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip transaction attributes and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driver statements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue and income statement classification.\n\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data.

(\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.\n\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.

Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in particular, our impairment assessment related to the determination of the fair values of certain investments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users.", "start_char_idx": 419407, "end_char_idx": 422305, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3810e3b0-2dc9-4392-a8c5-dd8e0fb776d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3810e3b0-2dc9-4392-a8c5-dd8e0fb776d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e94bb976-f2ee-4585-8387-d2860312e06e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dc2781b3c1da5891f0530b8dd1a01495fdb2e8e43d1f080ab984babe31ca384b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fda2f4f2-a3de-46a3-aef2-6c1711c1d2ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "46e9ffc5ac25b447796d016dcdc3ed0d6e051f30676cc5aca6551197ac5524e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e12488f-f21b-49c6-add6-e72e1c34540f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4a0c5dcb131d59c855105271d2dec482b306b5d1409b852c42037a9e57d140cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our other receivables primarily consist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims.

Our operations have historically been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, additional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives. We may not be able to obtain additional\n\n82\n\nfinancing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic conditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented, including business activities and travel restrictions, and \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d orders, that have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings.

The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be further resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate bonds.

Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the amount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d). Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risk transfer arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator for ongoing handling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense.

We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Our marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whether non-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative. Non-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities. If an impairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment. We include investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDebt Securities\n\nAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the transaction.

In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors.

We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\n\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:\n\nLevel 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\nOur primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants.

These evaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive our revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of our platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from customers' use of Freight services.\n\nWe periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.\n\n87\n\nMobility and Delivery Agreements\n\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform.", "start_char_idx": 448789, "end_char_idx": 451369, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b01c85a-37ff-498a-800b-603d0abbc8a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b01c85a-37ff-498a-800b-603d0abbc8a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e94bb976-f2ee-4585-8387-d2860312e06e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dc2781b3c1da5891f0530b8dd1a01495fdb2e8e43d1f080ab984babe31ca384b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f2a6424-293c-47b4-9029-6ea3a5c0742a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "7441e3b3bbe85d60c22fc31cbff7824c91b198b449777fbdc48294cc591e5f33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b480d3cb-bf7f-4e73-b43c-98db09cd9058", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f48162b6c291166a43b2b41461104571d6b969b2075a5f5bd545dcacfb17b445", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.\n\n87\n\nMobility and Delivery Agreements\n\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.\n\nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\n\nIn 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to Drivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.

We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring.

As a result, this class of end-users are not our customers.\n\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\n\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d).

As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services.

Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfully completed transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing the service to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Couriers to provide delivery services. In these markets, we are the principal for the Delivery services and present Delivery revenue on a gross basis because we are primarily responsible for the services.\n\nMobility\n\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfully complete a trip via the Platform. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.\n\nDepending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers.

New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We were responsible for providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of each trip. After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material. Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture.\n\nAdvanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Revenue\n\nIn 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next\u2013generation self-driving technology. Under this collaboration agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition and presentation of the consideration received as collaboration revenue.

Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\n\nIncentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were immaterial.\n\nIn some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction. In these transactions, the resulting shortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\n\nAdvertising Revenue\n\nWe derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform. Advertising revenue is recognized when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks.

Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain.

The insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.

Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\n\nOur Level 3 non-marketable debt securities and non-marketable equity securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 primarily consist of common stock investments and redeemable preferred stock investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.\n\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019s financing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the\n\n98\n\nguideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique\n\nprimarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\n\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\n\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions.

These observed inputs were considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that was applied to the valuation derived from Grab\u2019s latest financing transaction which occurred earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for Mobility services.

Due to the significant uncertainty about Grab\u2019s ability to repay the redemption amount of the securities on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected was considered to be less than the fair value of the securities.

As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from COVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, was less than their carrying value.\n\nTo determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM, weighted at 80% and 20%, respectively. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario, where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual securities within the investees\u2019 capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences. We computed a range of market adjustments based on observed market valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securities occurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs are considered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from the latest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us. A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of allocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event would result in higher valuation (due to access to public markets and reduction in cost of capital), reduces valuation uncertainty, and generally assumes market and macro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

Certain contingent equity issuances of MLU B.V. may dilute our equity ownership interest to approximately 33%.

We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of $13.4 billion and $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2021, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year, offset partially by the release of the valuation allowance due to deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the acquisitions providing an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.\n\nThe indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") means that indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities can be considered as support for realization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.

In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% of the outstanding membership interests. As a result, we obtained the controlling financial interest in CS-Global and accounted for the acquisition as a business combination. Concurrent with the CS-Global acquisition transaction, Uber, Cornershop and CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controlling interest in CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right through the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of the interests in CS-Mexico, contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (\u201cCS-Mexico Put/Call\u201d).
