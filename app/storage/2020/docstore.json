BUSINESS\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, as well as with other forms of transportation including public transit. We also connect Riders and other consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cDelivery People\u201d) for food, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Delivery People are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.", "start_char_idx": 10637, "end_char_idx": 13279, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54b7f86b-4ba4-47c3-bea7-8ab6161e04ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "54b7f86b-4ba4-47c3-bea7-8ab6161e04ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "608e1016-5c1f-46e5-9752-763b71fb5ecd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "eaec77e3580573450b12c875265c741fe6941653ce6652727f49e50b8d7ea4f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a5426895-e754-4b24-ad31-160ae6f3d311", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f5bc40e0e0dbcb69a8301d06bda6100ef6469ce7cef827c4d2cf17681c2e4cc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.\n\nOur technology is available in approximately 71 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\n\nOur Segments\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had four operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery, Freight and Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets. ATG and Other Technology Programs is focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate. On December 7, 2020, we announced the sale of Apparate USA LLC (\u201cATG Business\u201d or \u201cApparate\u201d), our subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technologies, to Aurora Innovation, Inc. (\u201cAurora\u201d). Our ATG Business is included within our ATG and Other Technology Programs segment. On January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora.\n\nMobility\n\nMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, Transit and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.", "start_char_idx": 13138, "end_char_idx": 15572, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5426895-e754-4b24-ad31-160ae6f3d311": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5426895-e754-4b24-ad31-160ae6f3d311", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "54b7f86b-4ba4-47c3-bea7-8ab6161e04ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "921e824511e3855ee5ac7840b33102acdf35994cf597bf5cffe2cd88c2c78ecd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4319b755-0c94-409e-840a-4e243a22b33f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "57343e8ad7fa5fb86e5e39988a29fce74a5c2ee0dbbe1680ecfa80921535eaf2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate.

At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nDuring 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem Inc. (\u201cCareem\u201d). Dubai-based Careem was founded in 2012, and provides primarily ridesharing and payments services to millions of users in cities across the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan. For additional information, see Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered and, in certain markets, also includes offerings for grocery and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launched our Delivery app over five years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\n\nDuring 2020, we received regulatory approvals to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (\"Cornershop\u201d\"), operating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico. We also completed the acquisition of Postmates Inc.

(\u201cPostmates\u201d) in an all-stock transaction and both companies began the process of integrating U.S. operations. The acquisition of Postmates brings together our global Mobility and Delivery platform with Postmates\u2019 business in the United States to strengthen the\n\ndelivery of food, groceries, essentials, and other goods. For additional information, see Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nFreight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n\nATG and Other Technology Programs\n\nThe ATG and Other Technology Programs segment is primarily responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle and ridesharing technologies, as well as Uber Elevate.

Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.\n\nMassive Network Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,000 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2021), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people. Leading Technology We have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.

We believe that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\n\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. We exited 2020 with over 5 million members for our Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Postmates Unlimited membership programs. In 2020, we rolled out our \u201cSuper App\u201d view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers, positioning Uber to become the operating system for your everyday life.\n\nCompetitive Environment\n\nWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets.

While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\n\nMobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for drivers and riders, including Lyft, Didi, OLA, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\n\nDelivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, GrubHub, Deliveroo, Glovo, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\n\nFreight.

These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are described below.\n\nMobility\n\nOur platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\n\nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, the six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model.\n\nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network Company (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.

For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. The Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit. We unsuccessfully appealed this injunction to the California Court of Appeal, which affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling and held that we must comply with the preliminary injunction order. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not \u201cfit and proper,\u201d including with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes.

For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d). Regulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.\n\nAntitrust\n\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws.", "start_char_idx": 35608, "end_char_idx": 38191, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "617ed689-7b7c-4763-8335-88e87bdbe7fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "617ed689-7b7c-4763-8335-88e87bdbe7fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e81e344a-b04c-4144-a566-b282fee1eba4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d8b5b2bb8d1825a56fe19d2a451b5b77f2ca0d4e6889337062add6cc3e6bf300", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3889625f-d235-4655-92dd-ad02309aa867", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "503ae6aec5fa435f19da1fec1f7fdda3eb23aa9538d6b9849355ebc00021da56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.\n\nAntitrust\n\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws.

We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools. We have historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being.

In response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, in May 2020, we announced reductions in workforce of approximately 6,700 full-time employee roles.\n\nIn addition, we asked that all employees who were able to do so work remotely. These decisions, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees. As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and social isolation. The issues of stress and balance were particularly exacerbated among caregivers of young children. To address some of these concerns, we instituted the Global Caregiver Enhanced Flexibility Policy for COVID.

Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates. In a 2020 global survey of Mobility Drivers, approximately 78% reported being satisfied with their experience driving with Uber.\n\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies from country to country, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n\nProtections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, and recently started to implement additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22, as described in more detail below.\n\nEarnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest). In addition to tips, Drivers using Uber\u2019s platform have earned over $133 billion from the end of 2015 through the end of 2020.\n\nProgression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over 100 undergraduate degree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship.

We have previously received significant media coverage and negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and a failure to rehabilitate our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n\nIf we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.\n\n11\n\nPlatform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\n\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future.

In addition, certain U.S. jurisdictions have issued emergency orders that require us to cap fees charged to merchants on Delivery. Furthermore, to support social distancing, we have temporarily suspended UberPOOL, our shared rides offering, globally.\n\nIn addition, we announced and implemented several COVID-related initiatives during the first quarter of 2020, including a financial assistance program for Drivers, as well as a commitment to provide 10 million free rides and food deliveries to healthcare\n\n12\n\nworkers, seniors, and others in need.", "start_char_idx": 59393, "end_char_idx": 61754, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "659b0242-a339-4ea8-8553-b8a4f8ad471d": {"__data__": {"id_": "659b0242-a339-4ea8-8553-b8a4f8ad471d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "09893870-ad2a-48ab-b5ef-c2dd07a3c648", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "9630633ae62901d1e7641fdc282b19368568559d2dc615761567434f5584c608", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1492c80a-b279-462f-98ec-202bc4a73a03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "403649bd13aa7c616e62950b570ec8843b9e79eecfeea58f504a6614c883bbfe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition, we announced and implemented several COVID-related initiatives during the first quarter of 2020, including a financial assistance program for Drivers, as well as a commitment to provide 10 million free rides and food deliveries to healthcare\n\n12\n\nworkers, seniors, and others in need.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we asked that all employees who are able to do so work remotely, and while we have since re-opened certain offices, it is possible that continued widespread remote work arrangements could have a negative impact on our operations, the execution of our business plans, and productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, and of third-party service providers who perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions.

We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.

We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $155 million as of December 31, 2020.

If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\n\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 codified application of what has been commonly referred to as the \u201cABC Test\u201d to the entire California Labor Code, California Wage Orders, and the Unemployment Insurance Code and became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. On August 10, 2020, following a hearing on the matter, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit. We appealed the decision and sought a stay of the preliminary injunction. On August 20, 2020, the California Court of Appeal granted an emergency stay of the injunction while an expedited appeal of the preliminary injunction decision is considered. On October 22, 2020, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling and held that we must comply with the preliminary injunction order no later than 30 days after the case is returned to the trial court.

Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although we do not expect that the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction will go into effect, that litigation remains pending, and we intend to move to dissolve the preliminary injunction. We also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. In addition, in January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and it is possible that other legal challenges to Proposition 22 could be filed.\n\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices.

In December 2018, New York City implemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2019, New York City issued a regulation to limit how much time drivers providing ride-hailing services can spend cruising streets in busy areas of Manhattan without passengers. In December 2019, a New York state judge struck down this regulation, which was to come into effect in February 2020. New York City is appealing this ruling. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle have in the past considered or may consider regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.

Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether.

In January 2021, we completed the ATG Transactions, which resulted in the merger of our ATG business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries.

Additionally, since April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational requirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data sharing requirement and a requirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services.

These additional authentication requirements may make our platform user experience in the EEA substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our platform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. Further, once SCA is implemented, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not completing all necessary authentication steps.

In September 2018, we entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations.

The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Brazil provides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect. These laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020.\n\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws\n\n39\n\nrelating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA.", "start_char_idx": 240949, "end_char_idx": 243565, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2063e31c-c5ca-4af5-be7f-d15887f97a2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "2063e31c-c5ca-4af5-be7f-d15887f97a2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "79b1a428-f759-4402-8a62-6f6d353094de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "7a7ff1046767cddb258b9e14e85870bcda84ada9419d0f3988a37fd7759619ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3701e044-837e-45ef-838a-f5e6db61feef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62672d7e1f54f9ab2fe9c211975169c54066ef3dde15388580f632c0a811ea84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws\n\n39\n\nrelating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA.

Such mechanisms have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny, and a recent decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs.

For example, in 2019, one of our insurance providers announced early termination of coverage and was replaced with other insurance providers. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.\n\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our\n\n41\n\ninsurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny these allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\n\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States.

The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our app was switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\n\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling.

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costs related to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuring and related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily for severance and other termination benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial. Restructuring activities during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 were not material.\n\nThese activities were designed to generate an aggregate cost savings of at least $1.0 billion annually when compared to our original fourth quarter 2020 planned cost structure, with the largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce.

The cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.\n\nLimitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.", "start_char_idx": 374007, "end_char_idx": 376360, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "695cc9cd-bf68-4db2-8d95-64d1d1951e26": {"__data__": {"id_": "695cc9cd-bf68-4db2-8d95-64d1d1951e26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8aebac33-87fa-4fc4-8a01-15f108376a1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "0d0b194556f695ea1b25196b3e71b22ba733523b589ee2ac27ac1335dda72f6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a383fd1-dd25-4b53-bd07-d94a02851136", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f23c97f53b05558cb2d5504b0e28e770e01a066984361d1367a78cd5b0a78f9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.", "start_char_idx": 396248, "end_char_idx": 399081, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac25af6c-d2db-46f8-a86f-a8d11a709b19": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac25af6c-d2db-46f8-a86f-a8d11a709b19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "23666b36-7fbd-4162-a74e-2aca2a360aa6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "4b95bc3933333ee3a7f874463c4c26dfc6fe3dde91a1641cd724d4f9470c57c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc773b01-47da-494c-882c-f4d0317d0017", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "518d5515d75db6d3c79d7be96a721b56a2f2ca9fdde84a24f7667b40524532e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or Delivery meal delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we have no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.\n\nFurther, judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions. The assessment of\n\n76\n\nwhether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\n\nIn certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. Because we have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips, and because we cannot control whether Drivers will generate future earnings that we can offset to collect our service fee, we have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.", "start_char_idx": 398683, "end_char_idx": 401369, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc773b01-47da-494c-882c-f4d0317d0017": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc773b01-47da-494c-882c-f4d0317d0017", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac25af6c-d2db-46f8-a86f-a8d11a709b19", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "4cfc180247524872ef58c57444da9c7ca688ca55ea435515db10f69923fb8fd9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b25568b-45cb-4033-9970-7c1aa2c4ea3c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7fc2631835b7d07d333b77e6aa581471694fc8d6081abe72a4b9b6ea3a5970c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\n\nDriver Incentives\n\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Driver incentives that are not for a distinct service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the Drivers at the time or as they are earned by the Drivers, depending on the type of Driver incentive.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we changed our accounting policy related to the presentation of cumulative payments to Drivers in excess of cumulative revenue from Drivers. Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.

The amount recorded is the lesser of the amount of the Driver incentive paid or the established fair market value of the distinct service received. Fair market value of the distinct service is estimated using amounts paid to vendors for similar services.\n\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\n\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms and include:\n\nTargeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to specific end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage, or generally increase end-users\u2019 use of our platform. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or meal deliveries during a limited time period, and are akin to coupons. We record the cost of these discounts and promotions as sales and marketing expense at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.\n\nEnd-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform and the new end-user takes his or her first ride on the platform.", "start_char_idx": 401244, "end_char_idx": 403911, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b25568b-45cb-4033-9970-7c1aa2c4ea3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b25568b-45cb-4033-9970-7c1aa2c4ea3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc773b01-47da-494c-882c-f4d0317d0017", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "3ee7ec6a4f3997319923af0b010210f7f274d807aab6f595aaad6312f19448f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5f34381-75bd-4b70-8148-2a4164ef24a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ec134248e7be6f4914adf0f047a8764f8696d050fa826184553283b1247e44a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "End-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform and the new end-user takes his or her first ride on the platform.

We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expense as sales and marketing expense at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.\n\nMarket-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants to end-users for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market. Accordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the trip is completed.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired driver, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful lives, and discount rates.\n\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n77\n\nEmbedded Derivatives\n\nDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting.", "start_char_idx": 403686, "end_char_idx": 406393, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5f34381-75bd-4b70-8148-2a4164ef24a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5f34381-75bd-4b70-8148-2a4164ef24a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b25568b-45cb-4033-9970-7c1aa2c4ea3c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "b5a8fbce43eb0e08fa8d13af7d99ba266a4a2fc22623b10408a231b21a08fe70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c87c21c-052d-407f-aed1-924270c55607", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f401505ad4d20adf6f1529fad94df0b6de4dae10ee18df99cc2851b6e682c11a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\n77\n\nEmbedded Derivatives\n\nDuring 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed of conversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total number of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value. These conversion options are bifurcated from the underlying instrument and accounted for and valued separately from the host instrument. Embedded derivatives are recognized as derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We measure these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the period of change.\n\nWe value these embedded derivatives as the difference between the estimated value of these convertible notes with and without the Qualified Initial Public Offering (\u201cQIPO\u201d) conversion option (\u201cQIPO Conversion Option\u201d). The fair value of these convertible notes with and without the QIPO Conversion Option is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow model to discount the expected payoffs at various potential QIPO dates to the valuation date. The key inputs to the valuation model include the probability of a QIPO occurring at various points in time and the discount yield, which was derived by imputing the fair value as equal to the face value on the issuance date of these convertible notes. The discount rate is updated during each period to reflect the yield of a comparable instrument issued as of the valuation date.\n\nUpon closing of the IPO in May 2019, holders of these convertible notes elected to convert all outstanding notes into shares of common stock.

Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions.

We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties.

The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.\n\nAll estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from the estimated amounts.\n\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of our board of directors, and non-employee advisors.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2016 Term Loan Facility and our 2018 Term Loan Facility. The 2016 Term Loan Facility and 2018 Term Loan Facility are floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will\n\n80\n\nincrease the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the results of our operations.\n\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes and 2025 Convertible Notes outstanding will generally fluctuate with movements in interest rates and the market price of our stock. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $271 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\nInvestment Risk\n\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $12.1 billion and $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020.

Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest income by $22 million and $97 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our marketable debt securities portfolio.\n\nWe have significant risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned affiliates, as all of our investments are currently in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our investments was $10.1 billion, including equity method investments.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\n\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\n\n83\n\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers. The Company\u2019s Mobility and Delivery revenue was $9,993 million and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue and related discounts and promotions is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis, analyzing the role of the Company in the transactions and the related transaction attributes, including the type of discounts and promotions applied, utilized or earned by the end-user in the transaction and assessing their presentation, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing our audit procedures to evaluate whether transaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process, including controls over the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue and discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on sample basis, trip transaction attributes and assessing management\u2019s classification by evaluating the Company\u2019s role in the transaction, examining documentation related to arrangement terms, driver statements and rider receipts, discounts and promotions and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on revenue presentation and income statement classification.\n\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.

(\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cDelivery People\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Delivery People are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.\n\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 16 - Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\") for further information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nChange in Accounting Policy\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we changed our accounting policy related to the presentation of cumulative payments to Drivers in excess of cumulative revenue from Drivers. Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.", "start_char_idx": 458972, "end_char_idx": 461634, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67cb9821-8019-490c-b50b-842759585983": {"__data__": {"id_": "67cb9821-8019-490c-b50b-842759585983", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "46481b33-5637-41ad-8e68-5855663c1db6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "f043de3f91b243d4425d839703fe4103f4333796c343553b77a8fe6cba1d9728", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee23c825-5ec1-40ac-9da3-f83a6ce5e658", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "45c24299ee8a702e0b4b2a85b69b76cb226b0d05f0031bbdf4b4d75e0d8cf3ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nAs our business has evolved, we believe our new presentation policy is preferable as it better reflects the financial performance of transactions with customers across all of our businesses and provides more clarity about changes in both revenue and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, resulting in improved financial reporting and alignment with financial information used internally by management.\n\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, all periods presented below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effects of the change to revenue and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.

On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: the incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d) applied in lease accounting; fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities;\n\n94\n\ninsurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting certain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in particular, our impairment assessment related to the determination of the fair values of certain investments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global financial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations and financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.

Our operations have historically been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, additional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt instruments.\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic conditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented, including business activities and travel restrictions, and \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d orders, that have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for Mobility offerings. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak both globally and within the United States, including whether there will be further resurgences of COVID-19 in various regions, the distribution of vaccines in various regions, the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-user\u2019 behavior, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.", "start_char_idx": 465984, "end_char_idx": 468644, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77078130-4696-451e-9a1d-9b2e08a54e08": {"__data__": {"id_": "77078130-4696-451e-9a1d-9b2e08a54e08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "819de353-e33b-4269-901b-f03fa52b9202", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "52c04ae6ba5dcb43ecf2cc82d237a0960cbc9163dab49336ac4978d910668d58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b474750-c92a-44db-a755-deae6d433b19", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3861a4ba9bb8009146debabd3afedab5374d614dd1e2f8d3bd7a99b5fca0d228", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 consisted of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate bonds.

Equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We had no investments in equity securities whose fair value was readily determinable as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities. If an impairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment. We include investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDebt Securities\n\nAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair value. Investments in marketable debt securities include commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features are classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.\n\nWe consider our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets.", "start_char_idx": 481879, "end_char_idx": 484583, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5a007a5-a67f-49c3-9a30-fe04fb95989f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5a007a5-a67f-49c3-9a30-fe04fb95989f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3aabadd7-840c-44ae-96e2-10fecbce0586", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "4f041aafa9784f272669e6f382e039ed09c5ea95d8805fcac598030e039486b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "930c4c63-8ca3-4a83-8a38-cd29857a8568", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "93965e2a8ed83319196c96a9234094f37c73c9176bb119e7402bc134d9bf380d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We consider our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets.

We adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, on a modified retrospective basis. Under ASC 326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

At December 31, 2020, our investment in Lime Common Stock was our only equity method investments\n\n98\n\nfor which the fair value option was elected.

We record our share of the results of equity method investments one quarter in arrears within earnings in equity interests as loss from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. We recognize in the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, any required impairment loss. Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment.

We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\n\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:\n\nLevel 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\nOur primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt, and embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

These evaluations are complex, involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.

We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.\n\nDepending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers.

Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip.\n\nIn addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods. As we currently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, we concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements until collected from Drivers.\n\nMobility revenue also includes Other revenue primarily from financial partnerships, service fees charged to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d) and Vehicle Solutions.

We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.\n\nIn the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by Delivery People is the difference between the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Delivery People.

Revenue for Freight represents the gross amount of fees charged to Shippers for these services.

By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination. We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless of payment by the Shipper. Our sole performance obligation is the transport of Shipper freight using our network of independent freight carriers. We invoice the Shipper upon satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers. For each contract entered into with a Shipper, we are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods. We therefore control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper.

New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We were responsible for providing access to the e-bikes and scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of each trip. After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.

Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\n\nIncentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 were $136 million and $103 million, respectively. Amounts in 2020 were immaterial.\n\nIn some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction. In these transactions, the resulting shortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\n\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\n\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discounts and promotions and include:\n\nTargeted end-user discounts and promotions:\n\nThese discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage, or generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon.

We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be \u201cplain vanilla\u201d options, as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the expected term for non-employees based on the contractual term.

We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in its industry group. We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered.\n\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.\n\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law.

Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d).\n\nThe establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and / or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.

All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided.

Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach.

These observed inputs were considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that was applied to the valuation derived from Grab\u2019s latest financing transaction which occurred earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for Mobility services.

Also, during the first quarter of 2020, we recognized impairment charges to intangible assets of $23 million, property and equipment of $47 million and other current assets of $23 million in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations in our New Mobility reporting unit.\n\nIn light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions and demand for Mobility during 2020, we also considered whether it was more likely than not the fair value of our Mobility reporting unit was below its carrying value. Based on an analysis of qualitative and quantitative factors, including market valuation multiples of public companies operating in the same business and considering the significant excess of the fair value attributable to the Mobility reporting unit over its carrying value, we determined that Mobility goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020.\n\nWe performed an annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.", "start_char_idx": 582431, "end_char_idx": 584139, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1d09b27-4182-41e8-a2ae-b59af34747db": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1d09b27-4182-41e8-a2ae-b59af34747db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "59141950-41fb-456b-a4d5-91457adf7160", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "f954c3537eb36380322fd8f2a35f88e8092130162522c363287ad3fce9ad2f99", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "594ee1a7-07c0-49f9-85de-93f287147ead", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8be1e1d66359cb072acf8256195ae6202e848e7816439a7bfc4777bae8712d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We performed an annual test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nThe components of intangible assets, net as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 were as follows (in millions except years):\n\nGross Carrying Value Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value Weighted Average Remaining Useful Life -

Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method.\n\nSince we were in a loss position for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, basic net loss per share was the same as diluted net income per share for the periods presented. For the year ended December 31, 2018, all net income was allocated to noncumulative dividends on preferred stock, therefore basic net income per share was the same as diluted net income per share.\n\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.", "start_char_idx": 635988, "end_char_idx": 638023, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36c8b8d7-ea40-4dad-9b5b-322758820c9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "36c8b8d7-ea40-4dad-9b5b-322758820c9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13d2607a-0af2-4ff8-970f-23affbd907a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "184706ed64a4b5a7eaf0fb4fe3e63e2e48aee4c3ceea66995681e42fce93fdf5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "345db011-b97a-4a3b-b3f7-9bb19c273530", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31ef8b3ad4e232fe4897174caaf2de22412d88b6cef052015701171266a4fa7e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.\n\n134\n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts):\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Basic net income (loss) per share: Numerator Net income (loss) including non-controlling interests $ 987 $ ( 8,512 ) $ ( 6,788 ) Add: net loss attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax ( 10 ) ( 6 ) ( 20 ) Less: noncumulative dividends to preferred stockholders 997 \u2014 \u2014 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ \u2014 $ ( 8,506 ) $ ( 6,768 ) Denominator Basic weighted-average common stock outstanding 443,368 1,248,353 1,752,960 Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders (1) $ \u2014 $ ( 6.81 ) $ ( 3.86 ) Diluted net income (loss) per share: Numerator Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ \u2014 $ ( 8,506 ) $ ( 6,768 ) Add: change in fair value of MLU B.V.", "start_char_idx": 637831, "end_char_idx": 639065, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "345db011-b97a-4a3b-b3f7-9bb19c273530": {"__data__": {"id_": "345db011-b97a-4a3b-b3f7-9bb19c273530", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a89bf2d9-4e07-487d-b521-2a82e50ee697", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "d5f456854babc7c3a0afaa4506e54abb08d6a2db90f1a2ea9dd6c191f2d75f92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36c8b8d7-ea40-4dad-9b5b-322758820c9f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2020}, "hash": "6b27f87e7600c3adcb6346e7a61804e1a0ea285c941c8a0c5bdbeacdba3ce2c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0044f16d-8327-4ab4-beca-1ce53315c2fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f05a1201adc038d1d76967c4ecf45baa7e43d823431a23aa633866c45a97118", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "put/call feature ( 12 ) \u2014 \u2014 Add: noncumulative dividends to preferred stockholders 12 \u2014 \u2014 Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ \u2014 $ ( 8,506 ) $ ( 6,768 ) Denominator Number of shares used in basic net income (loss) per share computation 443,368 1,248,353 1,752,960 Weighted-average effect of potentially dilutive securities: Common stock subject to a put/call feature 407 \u2014 \u2014 Stock options 33,528 \u2014 \u2014 RSUs to settle fixed monetary awards 1,073 \u2014 \u2014 Other 623 \u2014 \u2014 Diluted weighted-average common stock outstanding 478,999 1,248,353 1,752,960 Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders (1) $ \u2014 $ ( 6.81 ) $ ( 3.86 )\n\n(1)\n\nPer share amounts are calculated using unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate.\n\nOn May 14, 2019, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 180 million shares of our common stock at a price of $45.00 per share.

AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the \u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.\n\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc.

The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws.

In November 2020, California voters voted in favor of Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

We contributed $345 million of cash, contracts in the region including Rider, Mobility Driver, and Eater contracts, and certain employees in the region to MLU B.V.

The put/call feature became exercisable at any time by either party from when it became effective in February 2019 through February 2022, at which point, if unexercised, the put/call right would expire.

Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.
